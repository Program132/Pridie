# Pridie

Pridie is a python program for my ethical hacking experience as beginner.

I decline all responsibility for non-legal attacks, I am a person who practices ethical hacking, legally and self-taught,
and in no case do I encourage people to use my personal tool to achieve dishonest intentions .
